## Homework 1 — Django TODO App (AI-Assisted)

This folder contains my solution for **Module 1: Introduction to AI-Assisted Development**.  
The goal was to build a small **Django TODO application** with the help of an AI assistant.

All code for this homework lives in:

- `01-todo/`

The app is a simple task manager where you can:

- View all TODO items in a modern purple-themed UI
- Add new tasks from the main page
- Mark tasks as **done / undo**
- Delete tasks directly from the interface

The Django admin panel is also enabled for the `Todo` model, but the main workflow is handled on the frontend page.


### Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Django**
- HTML + CSS (custom, no frontend framework)
- Git + GitHub for version control


### How to Run the Project Locally

From the repository root:

```bash
cd 01-todo
